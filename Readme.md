# 📘 Daily DSA (aka me vs my brain 🧠)

This repo is my **daily Data Structures & Algorithms practice log**.
One problem a day. Sometimes clean. Sometimes messy. Always learning.

Every problem gets its **own folder** with:

* the **solution code**
* a **README** where I explain what I thought I was doing 😅

---

## 📂 How this repo is structured (very serious stuff)

```text
Daily-DSA/
│
├── some-problem-name/
│   ├── solution.py
│   └── README.md
│
├── another-problem/
│   ├── solution.cpp
│   └── README.md
│
└── ...
```

* One folder = one problem
* Folder name ≈ problem name
* Language depends on my mood and the problem

No fancy structure. No framework. Just vibes and logic.

---

## 🧠 What’s inside each problem README

Every problem README usually contains:

* Problem explained in **simple words**
* Input / Output clarity
* Constraints (aka *why brute force cried*)
* Brute force idea (for honesty)
* Optimized approach (the “aha” moment)
* Dry run (to convince myself it actually works)
* Final code
* Time & space complexity
* Mistakes I made so I don’t repeat them (hopefully)

Basically:

> “Explain it like future-me forgot everything.”

---

## 🎯 Why this repo exists

* To build **consistency** (even on low-motivation days)
* To actually **understand DSA**, not just pass test cases
* To practice explaining solutions (hello interviews 👋)
* To track progress without overthinking structure

This is a **working notebook**, not a portfolio site.

---

## 📅 The rule (simple but hard)

* Try to solve **at least one problem daily**
* Some days it’s Easy
* Some days it’s Medium
* Some days it’s “why did I choose CS” 😐

Still counts.

---

## 🚫 What this repo is NOT

* ❌ Not a competitive programming flex
* ❌ Not perfectly organized
* ❌ Not bug-free (let’s be real)

It’s a place to **learn in public (or semi-public)**.

---

## 🧩 Where problems come from

Mostly:

* LeetCode
* GeeksForGeeks
* Codeforces
* Random links that ruin my confidence

Each problem README links to the source.

---

## 🧠 Note to future me (important)

If you’re reading this:

* Re-solve old problems
* Read the mistakes section (you *will* forget)
* Don’t judge past code too harshly — you were learning

Progress > perfection. Always.

---

## ☕ How to use this repo

1. Open any problem folder
2. Read the README first
3. Try solving it yourself
4. Then look at the solution
5. Realize you overcomplicated it (again)

Repeat.

### ⭐ Final thought

> One problem a day keeps the “I forgot DSA” panic away.
